# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Warmup times itself.** Every pass is measured with `mono_ns`, and the report
  gives the total plus, when there is enough evidence for it, how much slower
  the first pass was than the median of the rest. That difference is what warmup
  exists to move off the first request, and this file used to decline to say it
  because twill had no clock; it has had one since 1.7. Nothing is claimed from
  fewer than three passes, or when the first pass was not the slowest.
- **`tests/warmup_test.tw`**, which the file never had. It asserts the refusals
  rather than the speed: a timing assertion would be a claim about the machine
  the tests run on.

## v0.1.0 (unreleased)

First cut of shuttle, inference and serving for twill, written in twill.

It runs. `twill test tests` passes six suites and
`twill run examples/serve.tw` loads a published model and answers with it, both
on twill 1.7.1. This paragraph said the opposite until `mode systems` landed in
twill 1.6. See `docs/needs.md` for what the language still owes this library and
`README.md` for the status table, which names the test or the example behind
every row.

Added:

- Loading a selvedge archive, with integrity verified before the weights are
  trusted, and loading a bare parameter tree with a declared signature. The
  difference between a signature that is a fact and one that is a claim is
  stated at both call sites.
- Single, batched and streaming prediction, with the forward function passed in
  by the caller so the model stays the caller's.
- Input validation against the model's declared shapes, producing twill's kind
  of message with the axis named. A batch passed to the single-input path, an
  empty batch, and a forward function that returns the wrong number of rows are
  each diagnosed specifically.
- Dynamic batching with the latency-throughput trade expressed as two required
  numbers, neither of which has a default, plus a `validate` that refuses the
  configurations where a knob does nothing and a `report` that gives the
  realised trade next to the configured one.
- Warmup, at named batch shapes, with a written-out list of what it covers and
  what it does not, and a refusal to claim a saving nothing here measures.
- int8, float16 and bfloat16 with min-max and percentile calibration, a size and
  accuracy table where every figure is labelled DERIVED, GATED or UNMEASURED, and
  a `compare` that measures the accuracy cost on the caller's own held-out data.
  The numerics run on the language's real dtypes now: `.to(f16)` and `.to(bf16)`
  are correctly-rounded casts rather than the earlier hand-rolled approximation,
  int8 codes are centred into a real signed i8 tensor, and `stored_bytes` takes a
  `realised` flag separating the footprint today from the one after the packed
  buffer and a narrow archive encoding land upstream.
- Batch scoring over a dataset, chunked so peak memory is one chunk's
  activations, with progress reporting and an accuracy evaluation.

Deliberately not included in v0.1, and in most cases not possible:

- A network server, a port, or anything that listens. twill has no sockets.
- Any overlap between waiting and computing. twill has no concurrency.
- A progress time estimate or a warmup saving. twill grew `mono_ns` in 1.7 and
  no file here calls it.
- A quantisation size win yet. The dtypes round for real, but the bytes drop
  only once twill NEEDS-111's packed buffer and a narrow archive encoding land.
- Activation calibration. It would mean owning the forward pass, which shuttle
  deliberately does not.
